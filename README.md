# Overview 
This project is a simplistic visualization of inflammatory bowel disease's genetic predispositions. This is done through the retrieving of data from WikiData using a SPARQL query. The SPARQL query is subsequently called in Javascript through the use of an endpoint URL, and a d3js library is loaded and used to propogate the visualization.
