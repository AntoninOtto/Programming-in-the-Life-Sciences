# Overview 
This project is a simplistic visualization of inflammatory bowel disease's genetic predispositions. This is done through the retrieving of data points from WikiData using a SPARQL query. The SPARQL query is subsequently called in Javascript through the use of an endpoint URL, and a d3js library is loaded and used to propogate the visualization. 

# How to run:
In order to run the code, navigate to the 'finalProduct.html' file in the repository. Once in the file, select download, find the downloaded file and open it a browser.

# Research question: 
Are any of the genetic predispositions for IBD also present in other diseases? 

# Explanation:
It is known that IBD is not just a sporadic disease, but also has (to some extent) genetic predispositions. However, we also know that genetic predispositions are often not only related to one disease, but perhaps also with other diseases. In this project we will investigate whether IBD has any genetic predispositions in common with other diseases, such as autoimmune diseases. 

# Graphical display: 
Network analysis, in which diseases are represented as nodes and genetic predispositions are the edges that connect those nodes. The student can also consider using the size of the nodes or edges to show some additional information that they find useful.
